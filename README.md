# High Performance Computing for Economists

## Spring 2023, Princeton University

This series of lectures introduces economics students to basic techniques required for high-performance computing.
This is an abridged (and slightly modified) version of the same class taught by Riccardo Cioffi, who strongly built on materials by Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde. Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde's [website](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/teaching.html) also provides (slightly different) slides and some additional material.
